# Library (Log Your Books!)

What a project! Another banger from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). With the confidence I got from building [Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/brkyurun/Admin-Dashboard), I was able to put my problem solving skills to test.

One thing to note though, I think previously, this project also included either using localStorage or Firebase to store user data. I currently don't know enough about that, so I am planning to come back to this in future.

## Resources Used

During the project, I have referred to the resources below for building the UI:

- Tailwind CSS color palette for designing a color theme: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)
- MDI for SVG icons used in the UI: [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)

## Features

- Built using HTML5, CSS3 and vaniila JavaScript.
- Click "Add book" to add a book you've read or are planning to read (you can change the read status).
- Didn't mean to add that book, or changed your mind about it? Simply click "Delete" on the respective card ðŸ˜Ž.
- Built with soft colors to not tire the eyes ðŸ¤“.
- Soft, minimal design language to enable the user to just focus on the content.
